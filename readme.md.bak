PhiloModel: Interactive Philosopher Positioning Tool

PhiloModel is an interactive web-based tool designed to visualize and explore the philosophical positions of 100 influential thinkers throughout history. This tool allows users to:

- Compare philosophers across six different philosophical axes
- Filter philosophers by era and region
- Search for specific philosophers
- Customize the display by selecting which philosophers to show
- View detailed information about each philosopher

Built with React and Tailwind CSS, PhiloModel offers an intuitive interface for both casual users and serious students of philosophy. It provides a unique, visual way to understand the relationships and differences between various philosophical stances.

This project is currently in version 1.4 and is open to contributions and suggestions for improvement.
